//preliminary thinking:..
const span = document.getElementById("question");
//const question = Array of objects
//loop through it with a user keydown and a fcn to verify user answer something like:
document.addEventListener["keydown",function(tbd){
    
    console.log();
    tbd.key === question[i];
    hiddenAnswer[i] =tbd.key;
    question.textContent = hiddenAnswer;
}];
